Going to run sentinment analysis via Facebook's LASER multilingual text embedding to compare the original text of Final Fantasy VI with the official and a fan-made translation.

Methodology based heavily on [this post](https://towardsdatascience.com/basic-nlp-on-the-texts-of-harry-potter-sentiment-analysis-1b474b13651d), will use VADER to run some early analyses to get a sense of project viability.
